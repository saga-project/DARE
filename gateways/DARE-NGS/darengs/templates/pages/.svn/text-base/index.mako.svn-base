DARE-NGS is a Gateway for Next Generation Sequence data analysis. DARE-NGS supports Genome-wide analysis --
which is both computationally and data-intensive. DARE-NGS builds upon the Dynamic Application Runtime-Environment (DARE) Framework,
and is one of several Science Gateways for Life Science Applications built using DARE.
</p>
<p>
Gateways enable non-experts to seamlessly utilize High-Performance and Distributed Computing resources, such as the NSF's national production cyberinfrastructure
-- XSEDE, regional cyberinfrastructure resources such as LONI. DARE-based Gateways can be extended to utilize campus/departmental clusters too.
</p>
<p>
Currently, registered users who agree the data management policy can run BFast, Bowtie,
and BWA for mapping, our ChIP-Seq pipeline, and Tophat-fusion for fusion gene discovery.
More tools are coming. Currently DARE-NGS uses LONI and TeraGrid resources for production
and FutureGrid-Clouds for testing. DARE-NGS will be made available for a broad range of
private and commercial Cloud Services in early 2012.

At the moment, there are no general-purpose community accounts, and it requires registrations contacting us before using services.
